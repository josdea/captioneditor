# Caption Editor from Amazon Transcribe Output

- AWS Transcribe costs around $0.00050 cents per second of audio transcription. And it gives you 60 minutes a month free under their free tier. The output, however, is a large JSON (Javascript Object) with confidence intervals. This must be converted into a caption file in either the SRT or VTT format. This tool helps with this.
